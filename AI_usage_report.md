## 2026-08-17 — Stationery Request Management schema (SQL)

**Prompt:** User supplied a Mermaid `erDiagram` (Roles, RoleThresholds, Users, Suppliers,
Categories, StationeryItems, Requests, RequestItems, RequestStatusHistory, Notifications,
StockTransactions, AiInteractionLogs) and asked for it to be turned into a SQL file.

**What was done:**
- Read `__ai_agents/systemprompt.md`, `backend.md`, `frontend.md` for architecture/stack context (.NET 10, EF Core, SQL Server).
- Found an existing draft schema at `__ai_agents/Database/Project 3.sql` (earlier, less normalized version of the same domain) and used its file conventions (bracketed identifiers, `GO` batch separators, FKs added via `ALTER TABLE` after table creation) for consistency.
- Wrote `__ai_agents/Database/StationerySchema.sql`: full T-SQL DDL for the 12 entities in the diagram, with primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and default constraints derived from the diagram's cardinalities and field types.

**Assumptions made (flagged for review, not silently decided):**
- `Requests.Status` and `StockTransactions.TxType` got `CHECK` constraints with a guessed set of enum values (`Pending/Approved/Rejected/PartiallyApproved/Cancelled/Fulfilled` and `Inbound/Outbound/Adjustment/Return`) since the diagram only specified the columns as `nvarchar`, not their allowed values.
- All foreign keys referencing `Users` use `ON DELETE NO ACTION` — SQL Server disallows multiple cascade paths converging on one table (five different FKs point at `Users`: superior, requestor, approver, recipient, actor, invoker), and cascading deletes through employee/audit history is generally unsafe. `IsActive` is the intended way to deactivate a user.
- `RequestItems.LineTotal` was kept as a stored column (per the diagram) rather than a computed column — the diagram lists it as a plain `decimal` attribute, so keeping `Quantity * UnitCostSnapshot` in sync is left to the Application layer.
- `Notifications.RequestId` and `StockTransactions.RequestId` were made nullable to allow for notifications/stock movements not tied to a specific request (e.g. manual restocks). This wasn't explicit in the diagram's cardinality notation.
- Did not overwrite the existing `Project 3.sql` draft — created a new file instead so both can be diffed before deciding which supersedes the other.

**Not yet done:** No EF Core entity classes, migrations, or `DataContext` configuration were generated — this pass only covers the raw SQL DDL requested.
